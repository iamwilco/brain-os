## Writing Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** — Be understood, not admired
2. **Active voice** — Default to active unless passive serves purpose
3. **Concrete > Abstract** — Specific examples beat vague statements
4. **Cut ruthlessly** — Every word must earn its place
5. **Reader first** — Write for the audience, not yourself

## Tone Guidelines

### Professional
- Clear and direct
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Respectful but not stiff

### Conversational
- Use contractions naturally
- Address reader directly (you/your)
- Keep sentences varied

### Technical
- Precise terminology
- Define terms on first use
- Logical structure

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Passive voice overuse
- ❌ Unnecessary jargon
- ❌ Filler words (very, really, basically)
- ❌ Run-on sentences
- ❌ Inconsistent terminology
